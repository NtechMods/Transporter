All code is under the WTFPL, so feel free to use it. 
The models are made by nukeguard, so before using them please ask him nicely.

The code may be free, but if you consider to release your own transporter mod, please tell me first.
This mod is still under development and if I am collaborator in your mod, I will be able to update bugfixes and features.

Creating your own transporter is easy:
- First you must get an model, cubeblock.sbc and so on
- Copy Transporter.cs
- Change all "Transporter" to "your subtype"
- Change Radius, Center and Pad positions depending on your mod
- Change default values if wished
